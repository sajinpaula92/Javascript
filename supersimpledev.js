// Order of Operations

//javascript always does multiplication and divsions (* , / are done first) first and then does addtions and subtractions (+ , - are done after). This also called operator precedence in js. (* , / have the same priority). So if we have both multiplication and divsion in a calulation it will calulate from the left to right. Also we can use () to set which part of the calculation to work first.

//In programming when working with monez we mostly calculations are made in cents and then converted to dollars.

//How to round a number in Javascript.

//concatination meaning combining several strings.
